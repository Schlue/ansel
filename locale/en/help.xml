  <title>Uploading Images: Overview</title>

  <para>
    You can upload most common kinds of images. If there is a problem
    with an uploaded file, you will be notified, so when in doubt,
    give it a try. You also have two options if you have a lot of
    images to upload at once. You can upload a ZIP file of all of the
    images, and they will all be processed at once.
